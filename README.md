## Why Codex-only?

Most "AI PPT" skills wrap Gemini / OpenAI Image / Nano Banana API calls — every slide costs money. **Codex has built-in `image_gen`**: it's already paid for via your Codex subscription. The whole point of this skill is to use that built-in capability instead of burning a second image API.

If you run this skill in Claude Code or Cursor, the built-in `image_gen` doesn't exist there, and the skill won't work as intended. Use [`huashu-design`](https://github.com/alchaincyf/huashu-design) (HTML-native) or [`huashu-wechat-image`](https://github.com/alchaincyf/huashu-skills) (Gemini-backed) for those runtimes.

## What it does

Four delivery paths, all powered by Codex's `image_gen`:

| Path | Output | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| **Path 1 · AI Image PPT** (default) | PPTX + HTML deck, each slide is a full image | Presentations, course material, pitch decks |
| **Path 2 · HTML Image Deck** | Full-screen web deck (←/→ keys) | Quick preview, web-published decks |
| **Path 3 · Editable HTML → PPTX** | Editable text PPTX | **Only** when user explicitly says "I need editable text" |
| **Path 4 · Single Cover Image** | WeChat / Bilibili / YouTube / Xiaohongshu cover PNG | Article hero images, video thumbnails, marketing posters |

## Quick start

In a Codex session:

```
Use huashu-slide-codex to make a 10-page deck about [your topic].
```

That's it. The skill will:

1. Ask 1-3 clarifying questions (audience, tone, format)
2. Recommend 3 differentiated design philosophies (Bloomberg / Field Notes / Pentagram etc.)
3. Run a brand asset protocol if your topic involves a specific brand (downloads logo, product shots, UI screenshots → writes a project-local `brand-spec.md`)
4. Generate slides via `image_gen`, copy into your project, assemble PPTX + HTML

For a single cover image:

```
Use huashu-slide-codex to make a WeChat cover for my article about [topic].
```

The skill defaults to **3 differentiated versions** for important single images, so you have real choices instead of "the AI's best guess."

## Install

```bash
cd ~/.codex/skills/
git clone https://github.com/alchaincyf/huashu-slide-codex.git
```

Or wherever your Codex skill directory lives.

### Optional: image hosting

If you want to publish results to WeChat or other platforms that need permanent URLs, set up ImgBB:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your free ImgBB key from https://api.imgbb.com
```

The bundled `scripts/upload_image.py` uses Python stdlib only — no `pip install` needed.

## Core mechanics

### 🔴 Default path lock

In Codex environments, the skill **always defaults to Path 1 (AI Image PPT)**. The two — and only two — triggers for switching to Path 3 (HTML/editable) are:

1. User explicitly says "I want editable PPT" / "don't want image PPT"
2. `image_gen` actually fails to invoke (≥3 times)

The skill includes an explicit list of "forbidden self-justification" patterns to stop the agent from rationalizing away the default. This was added after a real-world failure where Codex talked itself into HTML mode because "the content needs precise version numbers."

### Page types & density tiers

Not every slide should have the same density. The skill enforces 4 page types:

| Type | Text ceiling | Required elements |
|---|---|---|
| Cover (always slide 01) | ≤8 char title + ≤16 char subtitle | Big title + hero visual, no info blocks |
| Section divider | ≤30 chars | 1 strong judgment + 1 visual metaphor |
| Content page (main) | 80-180 chars typical, 220 max | Title + 1-3 sentence explanation + 2-4 labels + visual |
| Conclusion page | ≤40 chars | 1 big judgment + 1 signature visual |

The skill explicitly warns the agent that the ceiling is **not a target** — "the sparse content page is more professional than the stuffed one."

### Brand Asset Protocol

If your topic involves a specific brand (Anthropic, Linear, your own company), the skill runs a 5-step protocol:

1. Ask user for what assets they have (logo / product shots / UI screenshots / brand guidelines)
2. Search official channels (`<brand>.com/brand`, `/press-kit`, press kits, App Store)
3. Download via curl
4. Verify + extract colors (`grep` hex codes from inline CSS)
5. Write project-local `brand-spec.md` + **mandatory user checkpoint** before generating any slides

The protocol exists because cover images / decks without real brand assets become "generic AI tech aesthetic." 30 minutes of asset gathering saves 2 hours of rework.

### Spread Frame + Mascot Continuity

For information-manual style decks (Field Notes × Anthropic, Penguin Books, Bloomberg Businessweek), the skill recommends:

- **Spread Frame**: A consistent 3-element layout across all content pages — top brand bar + free body + bottom conclusion strip. Body layout varies, frame stays.
- **Mascot Continuity**: If your brand has a mascot (a shrimp, a pixel character, an IP figure), have the mascot appear across content pages in different poses — turns a deck from "8 isolated infographics" into "a connected story."

Both patterns are validated by real-world delivery (OpenClaw Orange Paper PPT, 2026-05-23).

### Personal-brand asset injection (swappable)

The skill ships with three example pixel-style assets in `assets/personal-brand/` (`像素风头像.png`, `像素公众号头图示例.png`, `像素品牌资产.png`) — these are the maintainer's (花叔 / @AlchainHust) personal IP assets, included as a working example of the "personal brand auto-inject" pattern.

For your own use, you have two options:

1. **Replace**: Swap in your own logo / avatar / style example PNGs and edit the trigger words in SKILL.md (search for "花叔风格")
2. **Disable**: Delete `assets/personal-brand/` — the skill's main features (slides, single covers, brand asset protocol) all still work

## Iteration history

This skill went through 8 iteration rounds before this release, most driven by real-world delivery failures and successes. See [`results.tsv` in darwin-skill](https://github.com/alchaincyf/darwin-skill) for the full optimization log. Key learnings:

- **R3 (full_test)**: When pixel-style was triggered but Codex put 花叔 character on a coffee mug instead of as the protagonist — added a "character must appear as scene protagonist" rule.
- **R4 (full_test)**: For important single images, generating 3 differentiated versions × different design philosophies is always worth the extra 2 `image_gen` calls.
- **R6 (full_test)**: AI defaults to filling every slide to the ceiling — added page-type-aware density tiers ("ceiling is not target").
- **R7 (full_test)**: OpenClaw deck validated the Spread Frame + Mascot Continuity patterns.
- **R8 (full_test)**: Codex rationalized switching to HTML mode by claiming "content needs precision" — added the 🔴 default-path-lock rule with explicit forbidden-justification patterns.
